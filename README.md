    "We looked into whether North America was a better area for a software developer to immigrate than Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, it is necessary to comprehend the priorities of job seekers; aspects like pay, potential for wage growth, and job happiness are crucial in determining the best location.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we asked 3 questions:\n",
    "- Which location has the highest salary?\n",
    "- Which location has the highest salary growth?\n",
    "- which location has the highest career satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Data Understanding\n",

    "The data comes from the stack overflow 2017 survey [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). \n",
    "\n",
    "3- Prepare Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data preparation phase, we gathered the data, assessed it and then proceeded to clean it, focusing on our columns of interest, with python libraries of Numpy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "we graphed different behaviours that were relevant to the 3 questions\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Evaluate the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 3 questions, we arrived at the following conclusions:\n",
    "- Which location has the highest salary? North America\n",
    "- Which location has the highest salary growth? Both follow a similar pattern\n",
    "- which location has the highest career satisfaction? THey start the same in the first year of work, but then Europe has a drop in satisfaction of which never truly recovers until 20 years later.\n",

    "The blog is written on the following [link](https://medium.com/@thuhuyen.tmt/is-north-america-a-better-immigration-option-for-software-engineers-than-europe-9320396711a9)\n",

    "An overview of the investigation's findings: We came to the conclusion that North America is the greatest option in the end."
