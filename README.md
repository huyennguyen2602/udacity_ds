This is the repo of the Write a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project.

1- Business Understanding

We looked into whether North America was a better area for a software developer to immigrate than Europe.

For this, it is necessary to comprehend the priorities of job seekers; aspects like pay, potential for wage growth, and job happiness are crucial in determining the best location.

For this, we asked 3 questions:
- Which location has the highest salary?
- Which location has the highest salary growth?
- which location has the highest career satisfaction?

2- Data Understanding

The data comes from the stack overflow 2017 survey [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
Containing Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from learning to code to their favorite technologies to version control and the workplace experience of professional developers.

3- Prepare Data

For the data preparation phase, we gathered the data, assessed it and then proceeded to clean it, focusing on our columns of interest by using python libraries of Numpy and Pandas

4- Data Modeling

we graphed different behaviours that were relevant to the 3 questions by using the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.

5- Evaluate the Results

For the 3 questions, we arrived at the following conclusions:
- Which location has the highest salary? North America
- Which location has the highest salary growth? Both follow a similar pattern
- which location has the highest career satisfaction? THey start the same in the first year of work, but then Europe has a drop in satisfaction of which never truly recovers until 20 years later.

An overview of the investigation's findings: We came to the conclusion that North America is the greatest option in the end.
